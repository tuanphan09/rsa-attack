# Adaptive Chosen Ciphertext Attack on RSA PKCS #1 v1.5
This specific attack exploits the implementation flaws found in numerous servers, that is, they report whether the encoding of the message they have received is PKCS1-conforming. This allows the attacker to use the server as an oracle to which he sends several queries. Based upon the serverâ€™s reply, the attacker can gain information about the complete decryption of an intercepted ciphertext (hence the adaptive chosen ciphertext bit). <br />
